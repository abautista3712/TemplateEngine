## Description
    
 templateEngine is a program run on node.js that builds a team of employees using ES6 classes to keep the backend code concise. The program uses npm inquirer to ask the user what type of employee to add to the team in addition to details about that employee. Once the user inputs that they are done adding team members, the program provides a list of all added employees.
